# CAPTCHA
I started following this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tDHQIU2HB0

Then i got an error saying: Markup is not defined.
To fix that i had to find flask_recaptcha.py in python folder
then change the line "from jinja2 import Markup" 
to "from markupsafe import Markup" and seems to have fixed everything.
